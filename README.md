## Projects

- [Planet Hunters](https://blog.planethunters.org/) - online citizen science project
- [TESS Hunt for Young and Maturing Exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TESS_Hunt_for_Young_and_Maturing_Exoplanets) - exoplanet search project
- [TESS-Keck Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_TESS-Keck_Survey) - search project that uses the Keck I and the Automated Planet Finder (APF) to conduct ground-based follow-up of planet candidates

## Analysis

- [juliet](https://juliet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - a versatile modelling tool for transiting and non-transiting exoplanetary systems that allows to perform quick-and-easy fits to data coming from transit photometry, radial velocity or both using bayesian inference and, in particular, using Nested Sampling in order to allow both efficient fitting and proper model comparison.
- [exostriker](https://github.com/3fon3fonov/exostriker) - Transit and Radial velocity Interactive Fitting tool for Orbital analysis and N-body simulations
- [lightkurve](https://github.com/lightkurve/lightkurve) - A friendly package for Kepler & TESS time series analysis in Python.
- [eleanor](https://github.com/afeinstein20/eleanor) - a python package to extract target pixel files from TESS Full Frame Images and produce systematics-corrected light curves for any star observed by the TESS mission.
